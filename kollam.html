    <h1>KOLLAM</h1>
    <p>Kollam is an ISO 9001:2015 certified city corporation for the best Municipal administration and services.[18] As per the survey conducted by Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) based on urban area growth during January 2020, Kollam became the 10th fastest growing city in the world with a 31.1% urban growth between 2015 and 2020.[19] It is a coastal city on the banks of Ashtamudi Lake that took the title God's Own Country. The Ashtamudi Lake lie about 71 kilometres (44 mi) north of the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram. The city hosts the administrative offices of Kollam district and is a prominent trading city for the state. The proportion of females to males in Kollam city is second highest among the 500 most populous cities in India.[20] Kollam is one of the least polluted cities in India.[21]

        Four major trading centers around Kollam are Kottarakara, Punalur, Paravur and Karunagapally.
        
        Kollam is an ancient trading town – trading with Romans, Chinese, Arabs and other Orientals – mentioned in historical citations dating back to Biblical times and the reign of Solomon, connecting with Red Sea ports of the Arabian Sea (supported by a find of ancient Roman coins).[22][23] There was also internal trade through the Punalur Pass connecting the ancient town to Tamil Nadu. The overland trade in pepper by bullock cart and the trade over the waterways connecting Allepey and Cochin established trade linkages that enabled it to grow into one of the earliest Indian industrial townships. The rail links later established to Tamil Nadu supported still stronger trade links. The factories processing marine exports and the processing and packaging of cashewnuts extended its trade across the globe</p>
    <p>Kollam is the fourth largest city in Kerala and the fifth largest in terms of corporation area.[25][26][27][28] It is known for cashew processing and coir manufacturing. Ashtamudi Lake is considered the southern gateway to the backwaters of Kerala and is a prominent tourist destination at Kollam. The Kollam urban area includes suburban towns such as Paravur in the south, Kundara in the east and Karunagapally in the north of the city. Other important towns in the city suburbs are Eravipuram, Kottiyam, Kannanallur and Chavara.

        Kollam appeared as Palombe in Mandeville's Travels, where he claimed it contained a Fountain of Youth.[29][30] During the later stages of the rule of the Chera monarchy in Kerala, Kollam emerged as the focal point of trade and politics. Kollam continues to be a major business and commercial centre in the Southern Kerala. </p>
